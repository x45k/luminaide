# Lumina IDE
## What is Lumina IDE?
Lumina IDE is a code editor written in rust using the egui library. It is extremely lightweight, which compromises with a lot of features (e.g. creating files/folders within the ide (although this may come soon), syntax highlighting, etc), so don't use this if you want a full-feature ide.

## Who is this meant for?
This is meant for users with low-end systems that still want *something* to code with. If you have a computer that can run VSCode or Zed, use those.

## How do I install this?
As this isn't in any way mainstream, there is currently no official installer. If you truly want to use it, you can manually run it via rust (cargo run).

## I want to add a feature!
If you want to add a feature, make a fork, create a new branch, make your changes, and open a pull request.
